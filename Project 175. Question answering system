Project 175. Question answering system
Description:
A question answering (QA) system extracts precise answers from a context passage based on a user query. In this project, we use a pretrained transformer model (like distilbert-base-cased-distilled-squad) from Hugging Face to build a simple extractive QA tool‚Äîideal for applications like customer support, document search, or knowledge bases.

Python Implementation: QA System Using Transformers (Hugging Face)
# Install if not already: pip install transformers torch
 
from transformers import pipeline
 
# Load Hugging Face QA pipeline
qa_pipeline = pipeline("question-answering", model="distilbert-base-cased-distilled-squad")
 
# Context paragraph (can be replaced with dynamic text/documents)
context = """
Artificial Intelligence (AI) refers to the simulation of human intelligence in machines.
These machines are programmed to think like humans and mimic their actions. 
AI is being used in various fields including healthcare, finance, and transportation.
"""
 
# Sample questions
questions = [
    "What does AI refer to?",
    "Where is AI being used?",
    "What do machines do in AI?"
]
 
print("üß† QA Results:\n")
for question in questions:
    result = qa_pipeline(question=question, context=context)
    print(f"‚ùì Question: {question}")
    print(f"‚úÖ Answer: {result['answer']}\n")
üß† What This Project Demonstrates:
Uses a transformer-based QA model trained on SQuAD dataset

Inputs a context paragraph and natural language question

Outputs a precise answer span from the context
