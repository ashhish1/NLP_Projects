Project 161. Sentiment analysis for product reviews
Description:
Sentiment analysis extracts opinions and emotions from text, helping businesses understand customer feedback. In this project, we build a sentiment classifier that categorizes product reviews as positive or negative using a simple Logistic Regression model with TF-IDF features on real-world review data.

Python Implementation: Product Review Sentiment Classifier (Scikit-learn)

# Sample dataset (Amazon reviews or any CSV with 'review' and 'sentiment')
# For demo purposes, we'll generate a small dataset manually
data = {
    'review': [
        "Absolutely love this product! Works perfectly.",
        "Worst purchase I've ever made. Do not recommend.",
        "Pretty decent quality for the price.",
        "It broke after one use. Terrible quality.",
        "Great value for money. Very satisfied!",
        "The item never arrived. Bad experience.",
        "Highly recommend! Exceeded my expectations.",
        "It was okay, nothing special.",
        "Cheap material, not worth it.",
        "Fantastic product! Will buy again."
    ],
    'sentiment': [1, 0, 1, 0, 1, 0, 1, 1, 0, 1]  # 1 = Positive, 0 = Negative
}
 
df = pd.DataFrame(data)
 
# Train/test split
X_train, X_test, y_train, y_test = train_test_split(df['review'], df['sentiment'], test_size=0.3, random_state=42)
 
# Text preprocessing with TF-IDF
vectorizer = TfidfVectorizer(stop_words='english')
X_train_vec = vectorizer.fit_transform(X_train)
X_test_vec = vectorizer.transform(X_test)
 
# Logistic Regression classifier
model = LogisticRegression()
model.fit(X_train_vec, y_train)
 
# Predictions and evaluation
y_pred = model.predict(X_test_vec)
print("ðŸ“Š Classification Report:")
print(classification_report(y_test, y_pred, target_names=["Negative", "Positive"]))
 
# Confusion matrix

ðŸ§  What This Project Demonstrates:
Converts raw product reviews into numerical features using TF-IDF

Trains a Logistic Regression model for binary sentiment classification

Evaluates with classification report and confusion matrix visualization
