Project 192. Keyword extraction tool
Description:
A Keyword Extraction Tool identifies the most important words or phrases in a text that summarize its content. Itâ€™s useful for SEO, document summarization, and metadata generation. In this project, we extract keywords using TF-IDF scores, but it can also be extended with RAKE, YAKE, or transformer-based methods.

Python Implementation: Keyword Extraction Using TF-IDF (Scikit-learn)
# Install if not already: pip install scikit-learn nltk
 
from sklearn.feature_extraction.text import TfidfVectorizer
import nltk
from nltk.corpus import stopwords
import numpy as np
 
nltk.download('stopwords')
 
# Sample text for keyword extraction
text = """
Artificial intelligence (AI) is revolutionizing many industries, including healthcare, finance, and transportation. 
Through machine learning, natural language processing, and computer vision, AI systems are automating complex tasks 
and enabling intelligent decision-making in real time.
"""
 
# Define TF-IDF Vectorizer
vectorizer = TfidfVectorizer(stop_words=stopwords.words('english'))
tfidf_matrix = vectorizer.fit_transform([text])
 
# Get feature names and scores
feature_array = np.array(vectorizer.get_feature_names_out())
tfidf_scores = tfidf_matrix.toarray().flatten()
 
# Rank top N keywords
N = 10
top_indices = tfidf_scores.argsort()[-N:][::-1]
top_keywords = feature_array[top_indices]
 
# Output top keywords
print("ðŸ§  Top Keywords Extracted:\n")
for i, keyword in enumerate(top_keywords, 1):
    print(f"{i}. {keyword}")
ðŸ§  What This Project Demonstrates:
Uses TF-IDF scores to identify high-value words in a document

Ignores common stopwords and ranks keywords by uniqueness

Provides a quick, unsupervised way to summarize text topics
