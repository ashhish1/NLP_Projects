Project 164. Part-of-speech tagger implementation
Description:
Part-of-Speech tagging assigns grammatical categories (like noun, verb, adjective) to each word in a sentence. It's a foundational NLP task for syntactic parsing, information extraction, and language modeling. In this project, we implement a POS tagger using a pretrained SpaCy model to analyze English sentences.

Python Implementation: POS Tagging with SpaCy
# Install if not already: pip install spacy
# Then download model: python -m spacy download en_core_web_sm
 
import spacy
 
# Load the English SpaCy model
nlp = spacy.load("en_core_web_sm")
 
# Example sentence or paragraph
text = "The quick brown fox jumps over the lazy dog near the riverbank."
 
# Process the text
doc = nlp(text)
 
# Print each token with its POS tag and detailed tag
print("ðŸ§  Part-of-Speech Tagging:")
print(f"{'Token':<15} {'POS':<10} {'Tag':<10} {'Explanation'}")
print("-" * 60)
for token in doc:
    print(f"{token.text:<15} {token.pos_:<10} {token.tag_:<10} {spacy.explain(token.tag_)}")
ðŸ§  What This Project Demonstrates:
Applies SpaCy's POS tagger to annotate text with part-of-speech information

Differentiates between universal POS tags and detailed grammar-specific tags

Explains each tag in human-readable language
