Project 171. Spell checker implementation
Description:
A spell checker automatically detects and suggests corrections for misspelled words. In this project, we implement a simple spell checker using Levenshtein distance and word frequency from a known English dictionary. It's useful in search engines, writing tools, and input validation.

Python Implementation: Spell Checker Using textblob
# Install if not already: pip install textblob
# And run once: python -m textblob.download_corpora
 
from textblob import TextBlob
 
# Example sentences with spelling mistakes
sentences = [
    "I realy like this librarry.",
    "Ths projct is relly amzing!",
    "Welcom to the wrld of NLP.",
]
 
print("üîç Spell Checker Results:\n")
for sentence in sentences:
    blob = TextBlob(sentence)
    corrected = blob.correct()
    print(f"‚ùå Original:  {sentence}")
    print(f"‚úÖ Corrected: {corrected}\n")
üß† What This Project Demonstrates:
Uses TextBlob‚Äôs spell correction powered by word probability + edit distance

Automatically fixes common spelling mistakes

Handles both individual words and entire sentences
